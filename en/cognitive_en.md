# COGNITIVE REHABILITATION FOR ELDERLY USING PrimaStem ROBOTIC COMPLEX

## INTRODUCTION

PrimaStem is a robotic complex consisting of a programmable robot and a control panel with a set of command tokens. The complex is specifically designed for the prevention and correction of cognitive impairments in elderly people.

### Target Audience

- Elderly people with mild cognitive impairments
- Individuals after neurological diseases
- Patients in early stages of neurodegenerative diseases

### Contraindications

- Severe visual impairments
- Significant motor disorders of upper limbs
- Severe dementia
- Acute mental disorders

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Age and neurodegenerative diseases can lead to memory deterioration, decreased ability for abstract thinking, learning, and creative development. Sessions with the PrimaStem kit help slow down these processes by training various cognitive functions in a game format.

### Methodological Recommendations

### Session Organization

- Duration of one session: 30-45 minutes
- Frequency: 2-3 times per week
- Format: individual or small groups (2-4 people)
- Required breaks: 5-10 minutes after every 15-20 minutes of work

### Session Principles

1. Gradual increase in task difficulty
2. Consideration of individual characteristics and limitations
3. Creation of positive emotional atmosphere
4. Alternation of different types of exercises
5. Mandatory feedback and encouragement

## MAIN REHABILITATION DIRECTIONS

### Cognitive Functions

- Stimulation of intellectual activity
- Development of spatial thinking and memory
- Improvement of visual and auditory-verbal memory
- Training of logical thinking and mental arithmetic
- Development of planning and control skills
- Training of peripheral vision

### Social-Emotional Aspects

- Maintaining personal potential and social activity
- Creating opportunities for self-expression
- Overcoming communication barriers
- Formation of positive emotional background

## TRAINING VARIANTS AND GAME EXERCISES

### 1. Basic Exercises (Adaptation Period)

- Familiarization with command tokens
- Simple robot movements in straight lines
- Performing basic turns
- Creating simple command sequences

### 2. Spatial Thinking Training

### Route Building

- Shortest path
- With obstacles consideration
- Using random set of command tokens
- Following given algorithm
- Choosing correct route from proposed options
- Building reverse route

### Difficulty Levels

1. Determining end point from given route
2. Selecting correct route from list
3. Determining starting point from known endpoint

### Working with Real Spaces

- Modeling familiar spaces (rooms, house corridors)
- Planning routes in room
- Maze navigation

### 3. Planning Skills Training

- Building algorithm for daily activities:
    - "I'm at the store – shopping from list"
    - "Preparing to go outside – what are my actions?"
- Using cards with images of objects and actions

### 4. Spatial Memory Training

- Memorizing and reproducing routes (visually, by ear)
- Using mnemonics (Method of Loci)
- "MEMO" type game:
    - Finding and memorizing matching cards

### 5. Mathematical Games

- Mathematical mazes – moving through cells with examples
- Arithmetic route – adding/subtracting same number

### 6. Word Games

- Finding proverbs on the field
- Composing words from scattered letters
- Creating routes based on images with specific sounds

### 7. Pencil Games (Drawing)

### Graphic Dictations

- Building algorithm based on drawing
- Completing symmetrical half
- Correcting errors in algorithm
- Drawing mirror reflection
- Rotating figure by 90 degrees
- Creating patterns and ornaments using loops

### 8. Communication Games

### Competitive Exercises

- Collecting maximum bonus tokens
- "Monopoly" type game with robot
- Word game with letter search
- "Maze" board game for two players

## EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATION

### Control Methods

- Regular testing of cognitive functions
- Monitoring progress in task performance
- Collecting participant feedback
- Maintaining session diary

### Success Criteria

- Improvement in task performance indicators
- Increase in exercise complexity level
- Positive subjective evaluation by participants
- Transfer of skills to daily life

## PROGRAM ADAPTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Individualization

- Consideration of physical limitations
- Adaptation of session pace
- Modification of tasks according to participant interests
- Creation of individual progression plan

### Group Work

- Forming groups based on capability levels
- Organization of competitive elements
- Support of mutual assistance
- Creation of comfortable social environment
